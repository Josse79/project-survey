# Survey form with React

Survey with at least 3 questions and one summary built with React using states.


## The problem

Did codealong with the Technigo lessons.
First trying to concentrate on getting the components to work.
Then added own content.
Last doing the styling in CSS.
If I had more time I would have tried to add a progress bar.
